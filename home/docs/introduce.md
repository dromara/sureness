## üé° <font color="green">Introduction</font>

> [Sureness](https://github.com/dromara/sureness) is a simple and efficient open-source security framework that focus on the protection of REST API.  
> Provide authentication and authorization, based on RBAC.   
> No specific framework dependency (supports Javalin, Spring Boot, Quarkus, Ktor, Micronaut and more).    
> Supports dynamic modification of permissions.   
> Supports WebSockets and HTTP containers (Servlet and JAX-RS).    
> Supports JWT, Basic Auth, Digest Auth, and can custom auth methods.    
> High performance with Dictionary Matching Tree.      
> Good extension interface, demos and documentation.

> Sureness has a sensible default configuration, is easy to customize, and is not couple to any one framework, which enables developers to quickly and safely protect their projects in multiple scenarios.

### üìà Benchmark  

![benchmark](/img/docs/benchmark_en.png)  

**Benchmark test shows Sureness to lose 0.026ms performance compared to frameless application, Shiro lose 0.088ms, Spring Security lose 0.116ms.**    
**In contrast, Sureness basically does not consume performance, and the performance (TPS loss) is 3 times that of Shiro and 4 times that of Spring Security.**      
**The performance gap will be further widened as the api matching chain increases.**
